WE:WorkEase
This project is a comprehensive web-based productivity and automation tool designed to help users simplify, organize, and conquer their daily tasks and goals. Built for the Automation & Productivity hackathon, the app provides a unified platform for task management, habit tracking, and focused work sessions.

Problem Statement
In an increasingly busy world, managing daily schedules, staying on top of habits, and maintaining focus can be challenging. Our solution aims to solve this by providing an all-in-one application that automates reminders, simplifies task organization, and encourages building positive habits through an intuitive interface.

Features
User Authentication & Onboarding
Onboarding Flow: A welcoming, illustrative onboarding screen introduces the app's core purpose.

Secure Authentication: Users can create a new account or log in with an existing one to access their personalized dashboard.

Password Recovery: A "Forgot Password" feature allows users to easily reset their credentials.

Task Management
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks with a name, due date, and a specific time.

Configurable Reminders: Each task can be set to trigger an alarm or a notification at the scheduled time.

Daily Schedule View: The home page dynamically displays tasks for the selected day, which can be checked off as completed.

Manage All Tasks: A dedicated page lists all tasks, allowing users to review and delete them as needed.

Habit Tracking
Multiple Tracking Methods: The app supports three types of habit evaluation: Yes/No, Numeric, and Timer-based tracking.

Flexible Scheduling: Users can set habits to recur daily, on specific days of the week, or on specific days of the month.

Progress Visualization: A dedicated "All Habits" page shows a 7-day calendar for each habit, allowing users to track their progress and mark days as done or not done.

Focus Timer
Customizable Sessions: A dedicated timer page allows users to set a countdown in hours, minutes, and seconds.

Visual Progress: A doughnut chart provides a clear, real-time visualization of the remaining time in the session.

Control and History: The timer includes options to pause, resume, and reset. It also maintains a history of completed sessions to track productivity over time.

Audio and Motivational Feedback: An alarm sounds upon completion, and on-screen messages provide encouragement throughout the session.

Tech Stack
HTML: For the structure of all web pages.

CSS: For styling, including a clean, mobile-first design and a consistent bottom navigation bar.

JavaScript: For all interactive functionality, including data storage with localStorage, dynamic content rendering, and timer logic.
